# Model Completion Dashboard

#### Overview

OpenWorm has been collecting data about the C. elegans nervous system from [research papers and online databases](https://pyopenworm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_sources.html) . Now it has become important to record and track progress.
Model Completion Dashboard does exactly this, using PyOpenWorm as a data resource, this application represents the current set of data aggregated so far for OpenWorm nervous system modelling. The user can now know at a glance how far we have come in gathering data about the worm's nervous system and how far we still have to go.

This is the home page, where the cells are represented as part of a matrix. The color associated with each of the cell, denotes the level of completion of that particular cell.
Clicking on any one of those cells would take the user to the details pane of that cell.

The details pane would list down essential details about the cell as well as the ion channels associated with that cell.
Here we also have the ion channel matrix, in which each cell represents an associated ion channel, clicking on anyone of the cell, would take the user to the details pane of that ion channel

The Dashboard also supports search functionality to search for a particular cell or ion channel.
